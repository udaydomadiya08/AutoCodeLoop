AutoCodeLoop

AutoCodeLoop is an intelligent coding assistant that automatically writes, executes, and debugs code based on user input prompts. It continuously iterates through the following cycle until the code runs perfectly without errors:

1. Generate code from the user's input prompt.


2. Execute the generated code.


3. Detect and analyze any errors.


4. Automatically fix the errors.


5. Repeat the process until the code runs flawlessly.



This project streamlines the coding workflow by automating the development-debug cycle, saving time and effort while delivering working code tailored to user requirements.
